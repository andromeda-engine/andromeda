# Design Constraints

To enforce Andromeda's vision, and it's feasibility, we've developed a set of
design constraints and goals. Please try to follow them when contributing to
Andromeda! As we're developing, initial prototypes may bend or break the
constraints, just be mindful of how we can move towards the final desirable end
goal.

To help ensure that we're building an editor that's both useful to end users and feasible to maintain, we've developed a set of design constraints and goals. Please try to follow them when making and reviewing changes! As we're developing, initial prototypes may bend or break the rules: just be mindful of how we can move towards the final desirable end goal.
